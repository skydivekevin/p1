		<div class="col-md-8">
		<p>
			I started out in Southern California, where I was born and raised. I joined the Army out of high school, and was stationed in Germany. While in the army, I did two deployments to Iraq; once in 2004 and the other in 2006. After finishing my contract with the army, I studied aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University. Two semesters before graduation however, I got a chance to skydive professionally, and I took it. What followed was 7 years of skydiving all around the world, racking up about 7,000 skydives.

			Skydiving gets boring after so many jumps though, so I started learning javascript to keep my mind busy and sharp. I quickly discovered that I really enjoyed it, so I looked into how to move into that space professionally. Galvanize seemed like the best route, and was recommended to me by a couple of developer friends. Knowing how intensive it can be, I set out to be as prepared as possible, and studied hard for about 8 months before beginning classes. I'm sure glad I came prepared, because things move pretty quickly here!
